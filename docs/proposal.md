# Project Proposal - Microwatt Hackathon

This project adds a custom accelerator to the Microwatt CPU to process sensor data.
It will be tested in simulation and optionally on FPGA.

## Goals
- Design a moving-average accelerator in VHDL.
- Integrate it with Microwatt CPU.
- Run test firmware to process sensor inputs.
- Document methodology and results.

## Expected Outcome
A working open-source repo with hardware (VHDL), software (C), and documentation.
